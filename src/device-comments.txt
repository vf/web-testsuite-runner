* The confirm dialog after widget installation is unnecessary.
  Maybe a message like the "Uninstall succeeded" at the bottom of the screen.
  but no confirmation should be required.
* When trying to install the same widget again ask "Should current widget be replaced?"
  instead of "Application already installed".
* After successful installation ask if the user wants to start the widget.
* Make the letter-symbol in the top navigation bar clickable, or drawable like Android has it.
