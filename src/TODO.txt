TODO
* allow to modify the expectedResult/confirm message from within the test.
  See PIM.getAddresBookItemsCount()
* verify that requiredObjects OR test is given when adding a test, otherwise
  the test is useless
* make tpls DTL compat {{ var }}
* make test switch on/off what features etc. in the config.xml are required, must be included into the build process somehow
  (maybe using rhino+a more powerful tpl lang inside the config.xml.tpl)
* show ui.invalidConfig() when clicking on [not configured] in the headline (which is shown when the config was not found)


IDEAs
* Allow dependencies of tests, if test1 failed dont even run test2 since it will surely fail anyway
  e.g. when openURL() simple test fails the extended tests wont work either.
* add test priority to show a chart/stats in the end/statusbar
* Execute "requiredObjects" for a group and dont execute entire group of this is not fullfilled.
* Preselect which tests to run (Show groups and let user choose, all, or just some)


DONE
* Feature determination before starting tests, e.g.
  - onFocus only makes sense when task switching is possible (multiple apps), otherwise test useless
  - clipboardString - can only be read if a clipboard exists on the device (seems not the case yet)
Dont Do this! Let tests rather fail.
* pause() doesnt work :-(
* pause the test when the test instruction is on the screen





Set of terms

* configure the config.xml
		"config.xml":{
			"widget[xmlns]":false
			"widget[xmlns]":"http://sldkfjsldkjfls"
		}


Config
* screen width+heigth are configured in pixels
* DPI values are always integer values (no float!!!)
* allow extending config, ie H1 extends H1_Base and include least version number
