Version 1.8.2
=============

* get initial AddressBook item if possible only (feature might not be given)
* config.xml: Added tests for <jil:access> and <access> tag (WARP)
* send over more relevant userAgent data, such as navigator data, capabilities, such as HTMLVideoElement, JSON, HTMLCanvasElement, ...
